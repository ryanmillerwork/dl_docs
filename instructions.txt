dg_docs.json contains a list of custom commands.

We need to go through these docs one command at a time. It's very important to only work on a single command section at a time.

For each command:

1) test the examples and any other claims made in the docs, and correct or improve the docs wherever necessary. Many of the functions have incorrect documentation so you need to be thorough. It is important to be as concise as possible to prevent these docs from growing too large.

2) modify the format from the current JSON to an MD format more suitable for creating a vector store index. These should be stored in dl_docs.md. For example,

=== dl_abs (Arithmetic) ===
Synopsis
    dl_abs <list> | dl_abs <number>

Brief
    Computes the element-wise absolute value of a DynList or the absolute
    value of a single number.  Returns a new list containing the result(s).

Inputs
    • Type …… DynList_or_Number  
    • Length … 1  
    • Element types … numeric  

Returns
    • Type …………… DynList (new object)  
    • Element type … Same as input (float if input is mixed or float)  

Errors
    • TCL_ERROR  `dl_abs: invalid list operand` if the list is not numeric.  
    • TCL_ERROR  if the input list is not found.  

Example
    dl_tcllist [dl_abs [dl_flist -1.1 1.2]]   ;# → 1.1 1.2
    dl_tcllist [dl_abs -5.5]                  ;# → 5.5
